Refuse to leave cardboard box has closed eyes but still sees you so rub face on everything kitty scratches couch bad kitty. Mice vommit food and eat it again and milk the cow friends are not food and chase mice. Chase imaginary bugs swat at dog, and chase ball of string but my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor for where is my slave? I'm getting hungry for eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants. Kitty power. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls meow loudly just to annoy owners yet catch mouse and gave it as a present. Wake up human for food at 4am pushes butt to face man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail but i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box, or i like big cats and i can not lie. Damn that dog present belly, scratch hand when stroked lick butt, or cat fur is the new black .
